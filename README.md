# Dynamic Technology Adoption in the Smartphone Industry

This repository contains the full pipeline and empirical code for my PhD thesis:  
**"Dynamic Technology Adoption in the Smartphone Industry with Exogenous Technology Shifts"**

## üìä Overview

This research estimates a structural model of firm behavior in the U.S. smartphone industry from 2011‚Äì2021. Firms decide when to adopt new cellular technologies (e.g., 4G, 4.5G, 5G), while facing demand-side incentives shaped by consumer preferences and competition.

The project combines:
- Discrete Choice Demand Estimation (Berry-Levinsohn-Pakes / BLP)
- Dynamic Supply Modeling (Rust-style Nested Fixed Point)
- Real-world data from IDC, PhoneArena, and exchange rate sources

## üìà Estimation Flow

1. **Data Cleaning (`data_pipeline/`)**  
   Prepare a panel of smartphone products with consistent brand-model specs and technology classifications (4G, 4.5G, 5G).

2. **Demand Estimation (`demand_estimation/`)**  
   Estimate consumer preferences using BLP-style random coefficients logit demand. Instruments include cost shifters and product characteristic variation.

3. **Dynamic Supply Modeling (`supply_dynamics/`)**  
   Estimate firm adoption behavior using a dynamic discrete choice model. Technology availability is exogenous and evolves over time.
